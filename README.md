This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mariosh346/job-search-react
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd job-search-react
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  Run the development server:

    ```bash
    pnpm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Technical Approach and Decisions

This project was built using Next.js for its performance benefits, routing capabilities, and ease of deployment.
I used tailwind for css and material ui for ready components.
Data fetching was implemented using tanstack react-queries.
The component structure is organized to promote reusability and maintainability.
